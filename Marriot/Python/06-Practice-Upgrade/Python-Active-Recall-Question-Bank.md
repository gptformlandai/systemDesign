## 1. How to Use This Sheet

**Rules:**
1. Cover the page below each question. Answer out loud or write on paper.
2. Only uncover the answer section **after** you've attempted an answer.
3. Mark each question: ✅ (got it cold), ⚠️ (partial), ❌ (blank).
4. Revisit ❌ items the next day; ⚠️ items in 3 days.
5. A concept isn't mastered until you score ✅ three times in a row with no notes.

**Difficulty tiers:**
- 🟢 **Foundation** — must answer without hesitation
- 🟡 **Intermediate** — should answer with some thought
- 🔴 **MAANG** — can explain mechanics and edge cases cold

## 12. Tricky Output Quick Round

Answer each in < 10 seconds without running the code.

```python
# Q1
x = []
y = x
x.append(1)
print(y)
```

```python
# Q2
def f(a=[]):
    a.append(1)
    return a

print(f() == f())
print(f() is f())
```

```python
# Q3
print(True + True + False)
print(bool(0.0))
print(1 == True == 1.0)
```

```python
# Q4
funcs = [lambda: i for i in range(3)]
print([f() for f in funcs])
```

```python
# Q5
class A:
    x = 0
a = A()
a.x += 1
print(A.x)
print(a.x)
```

```python
# Q6
try:
    x = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    pass
else:
    print("no error")
finally:
    print("always")
```

```python
# Q7
gen = (i ** 2 for i in range(5))
list(gen)
print(list(gen))
```

```python
# Q8
a = (1, 2, 3)
a += (4,)
b = a
a += (5,)
print(b)
```

**Expected answers (cover until you've answered):**

| Q | Answer | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | `[1]` | `y` and `x` are same object; append mutates in-place |
| Q2 | `True`, `True` | Both calls return the same default list object |
| Q3 | `2`, `False`, `True` | bool is int; 0.0 is falsy; chained comparison |
| Q4 | `[2, 2, 2]` | Late binding — all lambdas see final `i=2` |
| Q5 | `A.x=0`, `a.x=1` | `a.x += 1` creates instance attr; class attr unchanged |
| Q6 | `always` | Exception caught → `else` skipped → `finally` runs |
| Q7 | `[]` | Generator exhausted after first `list(gen)` |
| Q8 | `(1, 2, 3, 4)` | Tuple `+=` creates new object; `b` points to old tuple |

## 13. Production Debugging Quick Round

Answer aloud before reading on.

🔴 **Q1:** Memory grows from 200MB to 3GB over 8 hours. First three things you check?
